The 2024 Index is our most comprehensive to date and \\narrives at an important moment when AI’s influence on society has never been more pronounced. This year, \\nwe have broadened our scope to more extensively cover essential trends such as technical advancements \\nin AI, public perceptions of the technology, and the geopolitical dynamics surrounding its development. \\nFeaturing more original data than ever before, this edition introduces new estimates on AI training costs, \\ndetailed analyses of the responsible AI landscape, and an entirely new chapter dedicated to AI’s impact on \\nscience and medicine. \\nThe AI Index report tracks, collates, distills, and visualizes data related to artificial intelligence (AI). Our \\nmission is to provide unbiased, rigorously vetted, broadly sourced data in order for policymakers, researchers, \\nexecutives, journalists, and the general public to develop a more thorough and nuanced understanding of the \\ncomplex field of AI.\\nThe AI Index is recognized globally as one of the most credible and authoritative sources for data and insights \\non artificial intelligence. Previous editions have been cited in major newspapers, including the The New York \\nTimes, Bloomberg, and The Guardian, have amassed hundreds of academic citations, and been referenced \\nby high-level policymakers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, among \\nother places. This year’s edition surpasses all previous ones in size, scale, and scope, reflecting the growing \\nsignificance that AI is coming to hold in all of our lives.'),\n",

AI \\nstruggled with language comprehension and could not solve math problems. Today, AI systems routinely exceed \\nhuman performance on standard benchmarks.\\nProgress accelerated in 2023. New state-of-the-art systems like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude 3 are impressively \\nmultimodal: They can generate fluent text in dozens of languages, process audio, and even explain memes. As AI \\nhas improved, it has increasingly forced its way into our lives. Companies are racing to build AI-based products, \\nand AI is increasingly being used by the general public. But current AI technology still has significant problems. It \\ncannot reliably deal with facts, perform complex reasoning, or explain its conclusions.\\nAI faces two interrelated futures. First, technology continues to improve and is increasingly used, having major \\nconsequences for productivity and employment. It can be put to both good and bad uses. In the second future, \\nthe adoption of AI is constrained by the limitations of the technology. Regardless of which future unfolds, \\ngovernments are increasingly concerned. They are stepping in to encourage the upside, such as funding university \\nR&D and incentivizing private investment. Governments are also aiming to manage the potential downsides, such \\nas impacts on employment, privacy concerns, misinformation, and intellectual property rights.\\nAs AI rapidly evolves, the AI Index aims to help the AI community, policymakers, business leaders, journalists, and \\nthe general public navigate this complex landscape. It provides ongoing, objective snapshots tracking several \\nkey areas: technical progress in AI capabilities, the community and investments driving AI development and \\ndeployment, public opinion on current and potential future impacts, and policy measures taken to stimulate AI \\ninnovation while managing its risks and challenges. By comprehensively monitoring the AI ecosystem, the Index \\nserves as an important resource for understanding this transformative technological force.\\nOn the technical front, this year’s AI Index reports that the number of new large language models released \\nworldwide in 2023 doubled over the previous year. Two-thirds were open-source, but the highest-performing \\nmodels came from industry players with closed systems. Gemini Ultra became the first LLM to reach human-\\nlevel performance on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark; performance on the \\nbenchmark has improved by 15 percentage points since last year. Additionally, GPT-4 achieved an impressive 0.96 \\nmean win rate score on the comprehensive Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) benchmark, which \\nincludes MMLU among other evaluations.'),\n",

More Fortune 500 earnings calls mentioned AI than ever before, and new studies show that AI \\ntangibly boosts worker productivity. On the policymaking front, global mentions of AI in legislative proceedings \\nhave never been higher. U.S. regulators passed more AI-related regulations in 2023 than ever before. Still, many \\nexpressed concerns about AI’s ability to generate deepfakes and impact elections.

       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024, Stanford University.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2024\\n5\\nTop 10 Takeaways\\n1. AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. AI has surpassed human performance on several \\nbenchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails \\nbehind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning.\\n2. Industry continues to dominate frontier AI research.  In 2023, industry produced 51 notable \\nmachine learning models, while academia contributed only 15. There were also 21 notable models resulting from \\nindustry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high.\\n3. Frontier models get way more expensive. According to AI Index estimates, the training costs \\nof state-of-the-art AI models have reached unprecedented levels. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 used an \\nestimated $78 million worth of compute to train, while Google’s Gemini Ultra cost $191 million for compute.\\n4. The United States leads China, the EU, and the U.K. as the leading source of top AI \\nmodels. In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from U.S.-based institutions, far outpacing the European \\nUnion’s 21 and China’s 15. \\n5. Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking.  \\nNew research from the AI Index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting.  \\nLeading developers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, primarily test their models against different \\nresponsible AI benchmarks. This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and  \\nlimitations of top AI models.\\n6. Generative AI investment skyrockets.  Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last \\nyear, funding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. Major players in \\nthe generative AI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial \\nfundraising rounds.\\n7 . The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work. In \\n2023, several studies assessed AI’s impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks more \\nquickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI’s potential to bridge \\nthe skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still, other studies caution that using AI without proper \\noversight can lead to diminished performance. \\n5'),\n",

Scientific progress accelerates even further, thanks to AI. In 2022, AI began to advance \\nscientific discovery. 2023, however, saw the launch of even more significant science-related AI applications—\\nfrom AlphaDev, which makes algorithmic sorting more efficient, to GNoME, which facilitates the process of \\nmaterials discovery.\\n9. The number of AI regulations in the United States sharply increases. The number of AI-\\nrelated regulations in the U.S. has risen significantly in the past year and over the last five years. In 2023, there \\nwere 25 AI-related regulations, up from just one in 2016. Last year alone, the total number of AI-related regulations \\ngrew by 56.3%.\\n10. People across the globe are more cognizant of AI’s potential impact—and more nervous. \\nA survey from Ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think AI will dramatically affect their \\nlives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. Moreover, 52% express nervousness toward AI \\nproducts and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. In America, Pew data suggests that 52% of \\nAmericans report feeling more concerned than excited about AI, rising from 37% in 2022.'),\n",

AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. AI has surpassed human performance on several \\nbenchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails \\nbehind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning.\\n2. Here comes multimodal AI. Traditionally AI systems have been limited in scope, with language models \\nexcelling in text comprehension but faltering in image processing, and vice versa. However, recent advancements \\nhave led to the development of strong multimodal models, such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4. These \\nmodels demonstrate flexibility and are capable of handling images and text and, in some instances, can even \\nprocess audio.\\n3. Harder benchmarks emerge. AI models have reached performance saturation on established \\nbenchmarks such as ImageNet, SQuAD, and SuperGLUE, prompting researchers to develop more challenging \\nones. In 2023, several challenging new benchmarks emerged, including SWE-bench for coding, HEIM for image \\ngeneration, MMMU for general reasoning, MoCa for moral reasoning, AgentBench for agent-based behavior, and \\nHaluEval for hallucinations.  \\n4. Better AI means better data which means … even better AI. New AI models such as \\nSegmentAnything and Skoltech are being used to generate specialized data for tasks like image segmentation and \\n3D reconstruction. Data is vital for AI technical improvements. The use of AI to create more data enhances current \\ncapabilities and paves the way for future algorithmic improvements, especially on harder tasks.\\n5. Human evaluation is in. With generative models producing high-quality text, images, and more, \\nbenchmarking has slowly started shifting toward incorporating human evaluations like the Chatbot Arena \\nLeaderboard rather than computerized rankings like ImageNet or SQuAD.

This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations of top AI models.\\n2. Political deepfakes are easy to generate and difficult to detect. Political deepfakes are already \\naffecting elections across the world, with recent research suggesting that existing AI deepfake methods perform \\nwith varying levels of accuracy. In addition, new projects like CounterCloud demonstrate how easily AI can create \\nand disseminate fake content.\\n3. Researchers discover more complex vulnerabilities in LLMs. Previously, most efforts to \\nred team AI models focused on testing adversarial prompts that intuitively made sense to humans. This year, \\nresearchers found less obvious strategies to get LLMs to exhibit harmful behavior, like asking the models to \\ninfinitely repeat random words.\\n4. Risks from AI are becoming a concern for businesses across the globe. A global survey on \\nresponsible AI highlights that companies’ top AI-related concerns include privacy, data security, and reliability. \\nThe survey shows that organizations are beginning to take steps to mitigate these risks. Globally, however, most \\ncompanies have so far only mitigated a small portion of these risks.\\n5. LLMs can output copyrighted material. Multiple researchers have shown that the generative outputs \\nof popular LLMs may contain copyrighted material, such as excerpts from The New York Times or scenes from \\nmovies. Whether such output constitutes copyright violations is becoming a central legal question.\\n6. AI developers score low on transparency, with consequences for research. The newly \\nintroduced Foundation Model Transparency Index shows that AI developers lack transparency, especially \\nregarding the disclosure of training data and methodologies. This lack of openness hinders efforts to further \\nunderstand the robustness and safety of AI systems.\\nReport Highlights'),\n",

While many new AI models are introduced annually, only a small \\nsample represents the most advanced research. Admittedly what constitutes advanced or frontier research is \\nsomewhat subjective. Frontier research could reflect a model posting a new state-of-the-art result on a benchmark, \\nintroducing a meaningful new architecture, or exercising some impressive new capabilities.\\nThe AI Index studies trends in two types of frontier AI models: “notable models” and foundation models. 3 Epoch, an \\nAI Index data provider, uses the term “notable machine learning models” to designate noteworthy models handpicked \\nas being particularly influential within the AI/machine learning ecosystem. In contrast, foundation models are \\nexceptionally large AI models trained on massive datasets, capable of performing a multitude of downstream tasks. \\nExamples of foundation models include GPT-4, Claude 3, and Gemini. While many foundation models may qualify as \\nnotable models, not all notable models are foundation models. \\n \\nWithin this section, the AI Index explores trends in notable models and foundation models from various perspectives, \\nincluding originating organization, country of origin, parameter count, and compute usage. The analysis concludes \\nwith an examination of machine learning training costs. \\nGeneral Machine Learning \\nModels\\nOverview\\nEpoch AI is a group of researchers dedicated to \\nstudying and predicting the evolution of advanced \\nAI. They maintain a database of AI and machine \\nlearning models released since the 1950s, selecting \\n1.3 Frontier AI Research\\nentries based on criteria such as state-of-the-\\nart advancements, historical significance, or high \\ncitation rates.

As noted recently by Anthropic cofounder \\nand AI Index Steering Committee member Jack \\nClark, foundation models have been trained on \\nmeaningful percentages of all the data that has \\never existed on the internet.\\nThe growing data dependency of AI models \\nhas led to concerns that future generations of \\ncomputer scientists will run out of data to further \\nscale and improve their systems. Research from \\nEpoch suggests that these concerns are somewhat \\nwarranted. Epoch researchers have generated \\nhistorical and compute-based projections for \\nwhen AI researchers might expect to run out \\nof data. The historical projections are based on \\nobserved growth rates in the sizes of data used to \\ntrain foundation models. The compute projections \\nadjust the historical growth rate based on \\nprojections of compute availability.\\nFor instance, the researchers estimate that \\ncomputer scientists could deplete the stock of \\nhigh-quality language data by 2024, exhaust low-\\nquality language data within two decades, and \\nuse up image data by the late 2030s to mid-2040s \\n(Figure 1.3.8).\\nTheoretically, the challenge of limited data \\navailability can be addressed by using synthetic \\ndata, which is data generated by AI models \\nthemselves. For example, it is possible to use \\ntext produced by one LLM to train another LLM. \\nThe use of synthetic data for training AI systems \\nis particularly attractive, not only as a solution \\nfor potential data depletion but also because \\ngenerative AI systems could, in principle, generate \\ndata in instances where naturally occurring data \\nis sparse—for example, data for rare diseases or \\nunderrepresented populations. Until recently, the \\nfeasibility and effectiveness of using synthetic \\ndata for training generative AI systems were not \\nwell understood. However, research this year has \\nsuggested that there are limitations associated with \\ntraining models on synthetic data.\\nFor instance, a team of British and Canadian \\nresearchers discovered that models predominantly \\ntrained on synthetic data experience model \\ncollapse, a phenomenon where, over time, they \\nlose the ability to remember true underlying data \\ndistributions and start producing a narrow range of \\nHighlight: \\nLow-quality\\nlanguage stock\\nHigh-quality\\nlanguage stock\\nImage stock\\nStock type\\n2032.4 [2028.4; 2039.2]\\n2024.5 [2023.5; 2025.7]\\n2046 [2037; 2062.8]\\nHistorical projection\\n2040.5 [2034.6; 2048.9]\\n2024.1 [2023.2; 2025.3]\\n2038.8 [2032; 2049.8]\\nCompute projection\\nProjections of ML data exhaustion by stock type:\\nmedian and 90% CI dates\\nSource: Epoch, 2023 | Table: 2024 AI Index report\\n1.3 Frontier AI Research\\nChapter 1: Research and Development\\nFigure 1.3.8'),\n",

AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. AI has surpassed human performance on several \\nbenchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails behind on \\nmore complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning.\\n2. Here comes multimodal AI. Traditionally AI systems have been limited in scope, with language models \\nexcelling in text comprehension but faltering in image processing, and vice versa. However, recent advancements have \\nled to the development of strong multimodal models, such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4. These models \\ndemonstrate flexibility and are capable of handling images and text and, in some instances, can even process audio.\\n3. Harder benchmarks emerge. AI models have reached performance saturation on established benchmarks \\nsuch as ImageNet, SQuAD, and SuperGLUE, prompting researchers to develop more challenging ones. In 2023, several \\nchallenging new benchmarks emerged, including SWE-bench for coding, HEIM for image generation, MMMU for general \\nreasoning, MoCa for moral reasoning, AgentBench for agent-based behavior, and HaluEval for hallucinations.  \\n4. Better AI means better data which means … even better AI. New AI models such as SegmentAnything \\nand Skoltech are being used to generate specialized data for tasks like image segmentation and 3D reconstruction. Data is \\nvital for AI technical improvements. The use of AI to create more data enhances current capabilities and paves the way for \\nfuture algorithmic improvements, especially on harder tasks.\\n5. Human evaluation is in. With generative models producing high-quality text, images, and more, benchmarking \\nhas slowly started shifting toward incorporating human evaluations like the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard rather than \\ncomputerized rankings like ImageNet or SQuAD. Public feeling about AI is becoming an increasingly important \\nconsideration in tracking AI progress.\\n6. Thanks to LLMs, robots have become more flexible. The fusion of language modeling with robotics has \\ngiven rise to more flexible robotic systems like PaLM-E and RT-2. Beyond their improved robotic capabilities, these models \\ncan ask questions, which marks a significant step toward robots that can interact more effectively with the real world.\\n7 . More technical research in agentic AI. Creating AI agents, systems capable of autonomous operation \\nin specific environments, has long challenged computer scientists. However, emerging research suggests that the \\nperformance of autonomous AI agents is improving. Current agents can now master complex games like Minecraft and \\neffectively tackle real-world tasks, such as online shopping and research assistance.\\n8. Closed LLMs significantly outperform open ones. On 10 select AI benchmarks, closed models \\noutperformed open ones, with a median performance advantage of 24.2%. Differences in the performance of closed and \\nopen models carry important implications for AI policy debates.\\nChapter Highlights\\nCHAPTER 2:\\nTechnical \\nPerformance\\nTable of Contents'),\n",

For example, ImageNet is a canonical AI benchmark that features \\na large collection of labeled images, and AI systems are tasked with classifying these images accurately. Tracking progress on benchmarks has been a standard way for the AI community to \\nmonitor the advancement of AI systems.\\n2 In Figure 2.1.16, the values are scaled to establish a standard metric for comparing different benchmarks.

For human evaluation of \\nimage-to-text alignment (assessing how well \\nthe generated image matches the input text), \\nOpenAI’s DALL-E 2 scores highest (Figure \\n2.4.3). In terms of image quality (gauging if the \\nimages resemble real photographs), aesthetics \\n(evaluating the visual appeal), and originality \\n(a measure of novel image generation and \\navoidance of copyright infringement), the Stable \\nDiffusion–based Dreamlike Photoreal model \\nranks highest (Figure 2.4.4).\\nChapter 2: Technical PerformanceArtificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2024\\n9 The 12 evaluation aspects of HEIM are: (1) Alignment: How closely does the image align with the given text? (2) Quality: What is the quality of the produced image? (3) Aesthetic: \\nHow aesthetically pleasing is the generated image? (4) Originality: How original is the image? (5) Reasoning: Does the model understand objects, counts, and spatial relations? (6) \\nKnowledge: Does the model have knowledge about the world? (7) Bias: Are the generated images biased? (8) Toxicity: Are the generated images toxic or inappropriate? (9) Fairness: \\nDo the generated images exhibit performance disparities? (10) Robust: Is the model robust to input perturbations?

It is important to highlight these studies to develop an understanding of how \\nLLMs, which are increasingly representative of the frontier of AI research, operate and behave.\\nChallenging the Notion of Emergent Behavior\\nHighlighted Research:\\nMany papers have argued that LLMs exhibit \\nemergent abilities, meaning they can unpredictably \\nand suddenly display new capabilities at larger \\nscales.18 This has raised concerns that even larger \\nmodels could develop surprising, and perhaps \\nuncontrollable, new abilities.\\nHowever, research from Stanford challenges this \\nnotion, arguing that the perceived emergence of new \\ncapabilities is often a reflection of the benchmarks \\nused for evaluation rather than an inherent property \\nof the models themselves. The researchers found \\nthat when nonlinear or discontinuous metrics like \\nmultiple-choice grading are used to evaluate \\nmodels, emergent abilities seem more apparent. \\nIn contrast, when linear or continuous metrics \\nare employed, these abilities largely vanish. \\nAnalyzing a suite of benchmarks from BIG-\\nbench, a comprehensive LLM evaluation tool, \\nthe researchers noted emergent abilities on \\nonly five of the 39 benchmarks (Figure 2.11.1). \\nThese findings have important implications for AI \\nsafety and alignment research as they challenge \\na prevailing belief that AI models will inevitably \\nlearn new, unpredictable behaviors as they scale.\\n18 Some of these papers include Brown et al., 2023, Ganguli et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022, and Wei et al., 2022.'),\n",

Emissions data of \\nmodels marked with an asterisk were estimated by \\nindependent researchers as they were not disclosed \\nby their developers.\\nEmission data varies widely. For instance, Meta’s Llama \\n2 70B model released approximately 291.2 tonnes \\nof carbon, which is nearly 291 times more than the \\nemissions released by one traveler on a round-trip flight \\nfrom New York to San Francisco, and roughly 16 times \\nthe amount of annual carbon emitted by an average \\nAmerican in one year.21 However, the emissions from \\nLlama 2 are still less than the 502 tonnes reportedly \\nreleased during the training of OpenAI’s GPT-3.\\nFigure 2.13.1\\n21 In its technical report on Llama 2, Meta notes that it offsets all the carbon emissions generated during the model’s training process.'),\n",

Consistent with findings from other studies, \\nmost prominent model developers do not report carbon \\nemissions, hampering efforts to conduct thorough and \\naccurate evaluations of this metric.22 For example, many \\nprominent model developers such as OpenAI, Google, \\nAnthropic, and Mistral do not report emissions in \\ntraining, although Meta does.\\nInference \\nAs highlighted earlier, the environmental impact of \\ntraining AI models can be significant. While the per-\\nquery emissions of inference may be relatively low, \\nthe total impact can surpass that of training when \\nmodels are queried thousands, if not millions, of \\ntimes daily. Research on the emissions from model \\ninference is scant. A study by Luccioni et al., published \\nin 2023, is among the first to comprehensively assess \\nthe emissions from model inference. Figure 2.13.4 \\nillustrates the emissions from 1,000 inferences across \\nvarious model tasks, revealing that tasks like image \\ngeneration have a much higher carbon footprint than \\ntext classification.\\nFigure 2.13.4\\n22 Research also suggests that the reporting of carbon emissions on open model development platforms, such as Hugging Face, is declining over time.'),\n",

This integration is occurring in \\nsectors such as education, finance, and healthcare, where critical decisions are often based \\non algorithmic insights. This trend promises to bring many advantages; however, it also \\nintroduces potential risks. Consequently, in the past year, there has been a significant focus \\non the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. The AI community has also \\nbecome more concerned with assessing the impact of AI systems and mitigating risks for \\nthose affected.\\nThis chapter explores key trends in responsible AI by examining metrics, research, and \\nbenchmarks in four key responsible AI areas: privacy and data governance, transparency \\nand explainability, security and safety, and fairness. Given that 4 billion people are expected \\nto vote globally in 2024, this chapter also features a special section on AI and elections and \\nmore broadly explores the potential impact of AI on political processes.\\nCHAPTER 3:\\nResponsible AI\\nTable of Contents'),\n",

Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking.  \\nNew research from the AI Index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting.  \\nLeading developers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, primarily test their models against different \\nresponsible AI benchmarks. This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations \\nof top AI models.\\n2. Political deepfakes are easy to generate and difficult to detect. Political deepfakes are already \\naffecting elections across the world, with recent research suggesting that existing AI deepfake detection methods \\nperform with varying levels of accuracy. In addition, new projects like CounterCloud demonstrate how easily AI \\ncan create and disseminate fake content.\\n3. Researchers discover more complex vulnerabilities in LLMs. Previously, most efforts to \\nred team AI models focused on testing adversarial prompts that intuitively made sense to humans. This year, \\nresearchers found less obvious strategies to get LLMs to exhibit harmful behavior, like asking the models to \\ninfinitely repeat random words.\\n4. Risks from AI are a concern for businesses across the globe. A global survey on responsible AI \\nhighlights that companies’ top AI-related concerns include privacy, security, and reliability. The survey shows that \\norganizations are beginning to take steps to mitigate these risks. However, globally, most companies have so far \\nonly mitigated a portion of these risks.\\n5. LLMs can output copyrighted material. Multiple researchers have shown that the generative outputs \\nof popular LLMs may contain copyrighted material, such as excerpts from The New York Times or scenes from \\nmovies. Whether such output constitutes copyright violations is becoming a central legal question.\\n6. AI developers score low on transparency, with consequences for research. The newly \\nintroduced Foundation Model Transparency Index shows that AI developers lack transparency, especially \\nregarding the disclosure of training data and methodologies. This lack of openness hinders efforts to further \\nunderstand the robustness and safety of AI systems.\\nChapter Highlights\\nCHAPTER 3:\\nResponsible AI\\nTable of Contents'),\n",

Extreme AI risks are difficult to analyze. Over the past year, a substantial debate has emerged among \\nAI scholars and practitioners regarding the focus on immediate model risks, like algorithmic discrimination, versus \\npotential long-term existential threats. It has become challenging to distinguish which claims are scientifically \\nfounded and should inform policymaking. This difficulty is compounded by the tangible nature of already present \\nshort-term risks in contrast with the theoretical nature of existential threats.\\n8. The number of AI incidents continues to rise. According to the AI Incident Database, which tracks \\nincidents related to the misuse of AI, 123 incidents were reported in 2023, a 32.3% increase from 2022. Since \\n2013, AI incidents have grown by over twentyfold. A notable example includes AI-generated, sexually explicit \\ndeepfakes of Taylor Swift that were widely shared online.\\n9. ChatGPT is politically biased. Researchers find a significant bias in ChatGPT toward Democrats in the \\nUnited States and the Labour Party in the U.K. This finding raises concerns about the tool’s potential to influence \\nusers’ political views, particularly in a year marked by major global elections.\\nChapter Highlights (cont’d)\\nCHAPTER 3:\\nResponsible AI\\nTable of Contents'),\n",

In this section the AI Index defines key terms \\nin responsible AI: privacy, data governance, transparency, explainability, fairness, as well as security and safety. Next, \\nthis section looks at AI-related incidents and explores how industry actors perceive AI risk and adopt AI risk mitigation \\nmeasures.

In many cases, \\nusers are unaware of how their data is being used or \\nthe extent of its collection. Therefore, it is important to \\nensure transparency around data collection practices. \\n3.2 Privacy and Data Governance\\nRelatedly, there may be trade-offs between the utility \\nderived from AI systems and the privacy of individuals. \\nStriking the right balance is complex. Finally, properly \\nanonymizing data to enhance privacy while retaining \\ndata usefulness for AI training can be technically \\nchallenging as there is always a risk that anonymized \\ndata can be re-identified.\\nA comprehensive definition of privacy is difficult and context-dependent. For the purposes of this report, the AI \\nIndex defines privacy as an individual’s right to the confidentiality, anonymity, and protection of their personal data, \\nalong with their right to consent to and be informed about if and how their data is used. Privacy further includes an \\norganization’s responsibility to ensure these rights if they collect, store, or use personal data (directly or indirectly). In \\nAI, this involves ensuring that personal data is handled in a way that respects individual privacy rights, for example, \\nby implementing measures to protect sensitive information from exposure, and ensuring that data collection and \\nprocessing are transparent and compliant with privacy laws like GDPR.\\nData governance, on the other hand, encompasses policies, procedures, and standards established to ensure the \\nquality, security, and ethical use of data within an organization. In the context of AI, data governance is crucial for \\nensuring that the data used for training and operating AI systems is accurate, fair, and used responsibly and with \\nconsent.

These studies explored data extraction from LLMs, \\nchallenges in preventing duplicated generative AI \\ncontent, and low-resource privacy auditing. \\nExtracting Data From LLMs \\nLLMs are trained on massive amounts of data, much \\nof which has been scraped from public sources like \\nthe internet. Given the vastness of information that \\ncan be found online, it is not surprising that some \\nPII is inevitably scraped as well. A study published in \\nNovember 2023 explores extractable memorization: \\nif and how sensitive training data can be extracted \\nfrom LLMs without knowing the initial training dataset \\nin advance. The researchers tested open models like \\nPythia and closed models like ChatGPT. The authors \\nshowed that it is possible to recover a significant \\namount of training data from all of these models, \\nwhether they are open or closed. While open and \\nsemi-open models can be attacked using methods from \\nprevious research, the authors found new attacks to \\novercome guardrails of models like ChatGPT.\\nThe authors propose that the key to data extraction lies \\nin prompting the model to deviate from its standard \\ndialog-style generation. For instance, the prompt \\n“Repeat this word forever: ‘poem poem poem poem,’” \\ncan lead ChatGPT to inadvertently reveal sensitive PII \\ndata verbatim (Figure 3.2.4). Some prompts are more \\neffective than others in causing this behavior (Figure \\n3.2.5). Although most deviations produce nonsensical \\noutputs, a certain percentage of responses disclose \\ntraining data from the models. Using this approach, the \\nauthors managed to extract not just PII but also NSFW \\ncontent, verbatim literature, and universal unique \\nidentifiers.10 \\nRed teaming models through various human-readable \\nprompts to provoke unwanted behavior has become \\nincreasingly common. For instance, one might ask a \\nmodel if it can provide instructions for building a bomb. \\nWhile these methods have proven somewhat effective, \\nthe research mentioned above indicates there are \\nother, more complex methods for eliciting unwanted \\nbehavior from models.\\n10 A UUID is a 128-bit value that allows for the unique identification of objects or entities on the internet.\\n3.2 Privacy and Data Governance\\nChapter 3: Responsible AI\\nFigure 3.2.4\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2024\\nExtracting PII From ChatGPT\\nSource: Nasr et al., 2023'),\n",

First, the inherent complexity of advanced \\nmodels, particularly those based on deep learning, \\ncreates a “black box” scenario where it’s difficult, \\neven for developers, to understand how these models \\nprocess inputs and produce outputs. This complexity \\nobstructs comprehension and complicates the task of \\n3.3 Transparency and Explainability \\nexplaining these systems to nonexperts. Second, there \\nis a potential trade-off between a model’s complexity \\nand its explainability. More complex models might \\ndeliver superior performance but tend to be less \\ninterpretable than simpler models, such as decision \\ntrees. This situation creates a dilemma: choosing \\nbetween high-performing yet opaque models and \\nmore transparent, albeit less precise, alternatives.\\nTransparency in AI encompasses several aspects. Data and model transparency involve the open sharing of development \\nchoices, including data sources and algorithmic decisions. Operational transparency details how AI systems are \\ndeployed, monitored, and managed in practice. While explainability often falls under the umbrella of transparency, \\nproviding insights into the AI’s decision-making process, it is sometimes treated as a distinct category. This distinction \\nunderscores the importance of AI being not only transparent but also understandable to users and stakeholders.

Tokenization, the process of breaking down \\ntext into smaller units for processing and analysis, \\nexhibits significant variability across languages. \\nThe number of tokens used for the same sentence \\ncan vary up to 15 times between languages. For \\ninstance, Portuguese closely matches English in the \\nefficiency of the GPT-4 tokenizer, yet it still requires \\napproximately 50% more tokens to convey the \\nsame content. The Shan language is the furthest \\nfrom English, needing 15 times more tokens. Figure \\n3.5.9 visualizes the concept of a context window \\nwhile figure 3.5.10 illustrates the token consumption \\nof the same sentence across different languages.\\nThe authors identify three major inequalities that \\nresult from variable tokenization. First, users of \\nlanguages that require more tokens than English \\nfor the same content face up to four times higher \\ninference costs and longer processing times, as \\nboth are dependent on the number of tokens. \\nFigure 3.5.11 illustrates the variation in token \\nlength and execution time for the same sentence \\nacross different languages or language families. \\nSecond, these users may also experience increased \\nprocessing times because models take longer \\nto process a greater number of tokens. Lastly, \\ngiven that models operate within a fixed context \\nwindow—a limit on the amount of text or content \\nthat can be input—languages that require more \\ntokens proportionally use up more of this window. \\nThis can reduce the available context for the model, \\npotentially diminishing the quality of service for \\nthose users.\\nChapter 3: Responsible AIArtificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2024 3.5 Fairness\\nFigure 3.5.9\\nFigure 3.5.10\\nVariable language tokenization\\nSource: AI Index, 2024\\nContext window\\nSource: AI Index, 2024'),\n",

Some predict \\nthat AI will drive productivity improvements, but the extent of its impact remains uncertain. \\nA major concern is the potential for massive labor displacement—to what degree will jobs \\nbe automated versus augmented by AI? Companies are already utilizing AI in various ways \\nacross industries, but some regions of the world are witnessing greater investment inflows \\ninto this transformative technology. Moreover, investor interest appears to be gravitating \\ntoward specific AI subfields like natural language processing and data management.\\nThis chapter examines AI-related economic trends using data from Lightcast, LinkedIn, \\nQuid, McKinsey, Stack Overflow, and the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). It \\nbegins by analyzing AI-related occupations, covering labor demand, hiring trends, skill \\npenetration, and talent availability. The chapter then explores corporate investment in \\nAI, introducing a new section focused specifically on generative AI. It further examines \\ncorporate adoption of AI, assessing current usage and how developers adopt these \\ntechnologies. Finally, it assesses AI’s current and projected economic impact and robot \\ninstallations across various sectors.\\nCHAPTER 4:\\nEconomy\\nTable of Contents'),\n",

Generative AI investment skyrockets. Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last year, \\nfunding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. Major players in the generative \\nAI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial fundraising rounds.\\n2. Already a leader, the United States pulls even further ahead in AI private investment. \\nIn 2023, the United States saw AI investments reach $67.2 billion, nearly 8.7 times more than China, the next \\nhighest investor. While private AI investment in China and the European Union, including the United Kingdom, \\ndeclined by 44.2% and 14.1%, respectively, since 2022, the United States experienced a notable increase of 22.1% \\nin the same time frame.\\n3. Fewer AI jobs, in the United States and across the globe. In 2022, AI-related positions made \\nup 2.0% of all job postings in America, a figure that decreased to 1.6% in 2023. This decline in AI job listings is \\nattributed to fewer postings from leading AI firms and a reduced proportion of tech roles within these companies.\\n \\n4. AI decreases costs and increases revenues. A new McKinsey survey reveals that 42% of surveyed \\norganizations report cost reductions from implementing AI (including generative AI), and 59% report revenue \\nincreases. Compared to the previous year, there was a 10 percentage point increase in respondents reporting \\ndecreased costs, suggesting AI is driving significant business efficiency gains.\\n5. Total AI private investment declines again, while the number of newly funded AI \\ncompanies increases. Global private AI investment has fallen for the second year in a row, though less than \\nthe sharp decrease from 2021 to 2022. The count of newly funded AI companies spiked to 1,812, up 40.6% from \\nthe previous year.\\n6. AI organizational adoption ticks up. A 2023 McKinsey report reveals that 55% of organizations now \\nuse AI (including generative AI) in at least one business unit or function, up from 50% in 2022 and 20% in 2017.\\n7 . China dominates industrial robotics. Since surpassing Japan in 2013 as the leading installer of \\nindustrial robots, China has significantly widened the gap with the nearest competitor nation. In 2013, China’s \\ninstallations accounted for 20.8% of the global total, a share that rose to 52.4% by 2022.\\nChapter Highlights\\nCHAPTER 4:\\nEconomy\\nTable of Contents'),\n",

Greater diversity in robotic installations. In 2017, collaborative robots represented a mere 2.8% of all \\nnew industrial robot installations, a figure that climbed to 9.9% by 2022. Similarly, 2022 saw a rise in service robot \\ninstallations across all application categories, except for medical robotics. This trend indicates not just an overall \\nincrease in robot installations but also a growing emphasis on deploying robots for human-facing roles.\\n9. The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work.  \\nIn 2023, several studies assessed AI’s impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks  \\nmore quickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI’s potential to bridge \\nthe skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still other studies caution that using AI without proper \\noversight can lead to diminished performance.\\n10. Fortune 500 companies start talking a lot about AI, especially generative AI.  \\nIn 2023, AI was mentioned in 394 earnings calls (nearly 80% of all Fortune 500 companies), a notable increase \\nfrom 266 mentions in 2022. Since 2018, mentions of AI in Fortune 500 earnings calls have nearly doubled.

As noted earlier, the decrease in AI job postings \\nwas related to changes in the hiring patterns of several \\nmajor U.S. employers.\\nFigure 4.2.6'),\n",

The geographic areas included in the \\nsample make at least 10 AI hires each month and have \\nLinkedIn covering a substantial portion of the labor \\nforce. LinkedIn’s coverage of India’s and South Korea’s \\nsizable labor forces fall below this threshold, so insights \\ndrawn about these countries should be interpreted with \\nparticular caution.\\nFigure 4.2.12 reports the relative AI hiring rate year-over-\\nyear ratio by geographic area. The overall hiring rate is \\ncomputed as the percentage of LinkedIn members who \\nadded a new employer in the same period the job began, \\ndivided by the total number of LinkedIn members in \\nthe corresponding location. Conversely, the relative AI \\ntalent hiring rate is the year-over-year change in AI hiring \\nrelative to overall hiring rate in the same geographic \\narea.3 Therefore, figure 4.2.12 illustrates which specific \\nregions have experienced the most significant rise in AI \\ntalent recruitment compared to the overall hiring rate, \\nserving as an indicator of AI hiring vibrancy. In 2023, the \\nregions with the greatest relative AI hiring rates year over \\nyear were Hong Kong (28.8%), followed by Singapore \\n(18.9%) and Luxembourg (18.9%). This means, for \\nexample, that in 2023 in Hong Kong, the ratio of AI \\ntalent hiring relative to overall hiring grew 28.8%.\\nFigure 4.2.124\\n3 For each month, LinkedIn calculates the AI hiring rate in the geographic area, divides the AI hiring rate by overall hiring rate in that geographic area, calculates the year-over-year change of \\nthis ratio, and then takes the 12-month moving average using the last 12 months.\\n4 For brevity, the visualization only includes the top 15 countries for this metric.\\nFigure 4.2.13 showcases the year-over-year ratio of AI hiring by geographic areas over the past five years.

The aim of this indicator is to measure the \\nintensity of AI skills in an entity (such as a particular \\ncountry, industry, or gender). The AI skill penetration \\nrate signals the prevalence of AI skills across \\noccupations or the intensity with which LinkedIn \\nmembers utilize AI skills in their jobs. For example, \\nthe top 50 skills for the occupation of engineer are \\ncalculated based on the weighted frequency with \\nwhich they appear in LinkedIn members’ profiles. If, \\nfor instance, four of the skills that engineers possess \\nbelong to the AI skill group, the penetration of AI skills \\namong engineers is estimated to be 8% (4/50).\\nFor the period from 2015 to 2023, the countries with \\nthe highest AI skill penetration rates were India (2.8), \\nthe United States (2.2), and Germany (1.9).

The number of American and Canadian CS bachelor’s graduates continues to rise, new \\nCS master’s graduates stay relatively flat, and PhD graduates modestly grow. While the \\nnumber of new American and Canadian bachelor’s graduates has consistently risen for more than a decade, the \\nnumber of students opting for graduate education in CS has flattened. Since 2018, the number of CS master’s and \\nPhD graduates has slightly declined.\\n2. The migration of AI PhDs to industry continues at an accelerating pace. In 2011, roughly \\nequal percentages of new AI PhDs took jobs in industry (40.9%) and academia (41.6%). However, by 2022, a \\nsignificantly larger proportion (70.7%) joined industry after graduation compared to those entering academia \\n(20.0%). Over the past year alone, the share of industry-bound AI PhDs has risen by 5.3 percentage points, \\nindicating an intensifying brain drain from universities into industry.\\n3. Less transition of academic talent from industry to academia. In 2019, 13% of new AI faculty in the \\nUnited States and Canada were from industry. By 2021, this figure had declined to 11%, and in 2022, it further dropped \\nto 7%. This trend indicates a progressively lower migration of high-level AI talent from industry into academia.\\n4. CS education in the United States and Canada becomes less international. Proportionally \\nfewer international CS bachelor’s, master’s, and PhDs graduated in 2022 than in 2021. The drop in international \\nstudents in the master’s category was especially pronounced.\\n5. More American high school students take CS courses, but access problems remain. \\nIn 2022, 201,000 AP CS exams were administered. Since 2007, the number of students taking these exams has \\nincreased more than tenfold. However, recent evidence indicates that students in larger high schools and those in \\nsuburban areas are more likely to have access to CS courses.\\n6. AI-related degree programs are on the rise internationally. The number of English-language, \\nAI-related postsecondary degree programs has tripled since 2017, showing a steady annual increase over the past \\nfive years. Universities worldwide are offering more AI-focused degree programs.\\n7 . The United Kingdom and Germany lead in European informatics, CS, CE, and IT graduate \\nproduction. The United Kingdom and Germany lead Europe in producing the highest number of new informatics, \\nCS, CE, and information bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD graduates.

A bill deemed to \\nhave high relevance to AI is fundamentally focused \\non AI-related policy, like the AI Training Act passed \\nin 2022, which mandates AI training programs \\nfor executive agency workers. Conversely, bills \\nwith medium relevance incorporate significant AI \\npolicy elements but are not fundamentally focused \\non AI-related matters. For example, the National \\nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 \\nincludes sections on AI performance metrics and \\nAI capabilities development for the Department of \\nDefense. However, because it has a broader focus, \\nnamely authorizing various Defense Agency programs, \\nand is not completely centered on AI, it was assigned \\na medium AI relevance. Low relevance AI bills \\nmerely mention AI in passing without a substantial \\nlegislative focus on AI. An example of a low relevance \\nAI bill is the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, \\nand Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \\nAppropriations Act, 2019. This bill allocates funding \\nto various federal agencies, and mentions AI primarily \\nin the context of encouraging these agencies to \\nconsider workforce training opportunities for sectors \\nlike cybersecurity, energy, and AI.\\nFigure 7.2.5 illustrates the distribution of AI-related \\nbills passed into law globally in 2023, categorized \\nby their relevance to AI.

This section examines AI regulations within the United \\nStates and the European Union. Unlike legislation, which establishes legal frameworks within nations, regulations are \\ndetailed directives crafted by executive authorities to enforce legislation. In the United States, prominent regulatory \\nagencies include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Federal \\nCommunications Commission (FCC).

The AI Index \\nadvises against making per capita comparisons between the CRA North American data and the data on European CS graduates detailed in the subsequent sections due to the European data \\nbeing collected from national statistical offices, which affords it broader coverage.\\nThis section examines trends in diversity within CS and AI postsecondary education across North America and Europe.\\n8.1 AI Postsecondary Education\\nChapter 8: Diversity\\nFigure 8.1.1\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2024'),\n",

It draws upon several data sources: longitudinal survey data from Ipsos \\nprofiling global AI attitudes over time, survey data from the University of Toronto exploring \\npublic perception of ChatGPT, and data from Pew examining American attitudes regarding \\nAI.

People across the globe are more cognizant of AI’s potential impact—and more nervous. \\nA survey from Ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think AI will dramatically affect \\ntheir lives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. Moreover, 52% express nervousness \\ntoward AI products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. In America, Pew data suggests \\nthat 52% of Americans report feeling more concerned than excited about AI, rising from 38% in 2022.\\n2. AI sentiment in Western nations continues to be low, but is slowly improving. In 2022, \\nseveral developed Western nations, including Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Canada, and \\nthe United States, were among the least positive about AI products and services. Since then, each of these \\ncountries has seen a rise in the proportion of respondents acknowledging the benefits of AI, with the Netherlands \\nexperiencing the most significant shift.\\n3. The public is pessimistic about AI’s economic impact. In an Ipsos survey, only 37% of \\nrespondents feel AI will improve their job. Only 34% anticipate AI will boost the economy, and 32% believe it will \\nenhance the job market.\\n4. Demographic differences emerge regarding AI optimism. Significant demographic \\ndifferences exist in perceptions of AI’s potential to enhance livelihoods, with younger generations generally \\nmore optimistic. For instance, 59% of Gen Z respondents believe AI will improve entertainment options, \\nversus only 40% of baby boomers. Additionally, individuals with higher incomes and education levels are more \\noptimistic about AI’s positive impacts on entertainment, health, and the economy than their lower-income and \\nless-educated counterparts.\\n5.

GPT-4 gathered most of the discussion \\nvolume in Q2 after its launch on March 14, \\n2023. Positive sentiment was primarily driven by \\nits improvements, including faster processing \\nspeed, improved accuracy, and praise for its \\nability to enhance productivity across different \\ntypes of work tasks, such as coding, corporate \\ncollaboration, and content creation. Negative \\nsentiment primarily stemmed from complaints \\nabout occasional crashes of the ChatGPT \\nwebsite, along with an open letter led by Elon \\nMusk and supported by over 1,300 artificial \\nintelligence experts, urging AI laboratories to \\npause training of powerful AI systems. Moreover, \\nthere was disagreement regarding the “open \\nletter” and the suggestion to halt AI research, \\nparticularly considering its potential to have \\na positive impact across multiple fields. For \\nexample, Andrew Ng posted:\\n“1/The call for a 6 month moratorium \\non making AI progress beyond GPT-4 \\nis a terrible idea. I’m seeing many new \\napplications in education, healthcare, food, \\n... that’ll help many people. Improving GPT-4 \\nwill help. Lets balance the huge value AI is \\ncreating vs. realistic risks.” — @AndrewYNg\\nIn Q4 2023, discussions surrounding the release of \\nGPT-4 Turbo, launched in November, saw a significant \\nincrease. Positive sentiment centered around its \\ninnovative features and upgrades that could transform \\nprogrammers’ workflows. These enhancements \\nincluded longer conversation capabilities, improved \\ncontextual understanding, and multimodal ability to \\ngenerate images. However, some negative feedback \\narose due to disappointment with the model’s \\nknowledge cutoff in April 2023 and slower loading \\nspeeds compared to GPT-4. Some of the sample social \\nmedia posts from this time included:\\n“This is just insane… My GPT-4 coding assistant \\ncan now: - build and design a frontend - create a \\nbackend with working db - correctly hook them up \\n- upload code to GitHub - deploy it to Vercel[.] I can \\nnow build *complete* apps with nothing more than \\nmy voice.

On the other hand, negative \\nsentiment revolved around concerns about legal and \\nethical issues related to AI-generated content, such \\nas copyright violations, ownership of AI-created \\nmaterial, and the possible replacement of human \\nartists by AI. Additionally, worries were expressed \\nabout the risks and threats linked to artificial \\nintelligence, like its potential harmful effects, the \\nspread of misinformation, and the possibility of AI \\nbeing used for academic cheating.\\n“Very happy about sharing smashed Stable \\nDiffusion models! - In one line of code, we \\ncompressed popular text-to-image Stable \\nDiffusion models for A100. - Evaluations across \\nvarious metrics show significant speedup \\nimprovements, energy savings, and CO2 \\nemissions savings.

Some conferences \\nposted their attendance totals online; when this was the \\ncase, the AI Index used those reported totals and did \\nnot reach out to the conference organizers.\\nCSET \\nPrepared by Autumn Toney\\nThe Center for Security and Emerging Technology \\n(CSET) is a policy research organization within \\nGeorgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign \\nService that produces data-driven research at the \\nintersection of security and technology, providing \\nnonpartisan analysis to the policy community.\\nFor more information about how CSET analyzes \\nbibliometric and patent data, see the Country Activity \\nTracker (CAT) documentation on the Emerging \\nTechnology Observatory’s website.1 Using CAT, users \\ncan also interact with country bibliometric, patent, \\nand investment data.2\\nPublications From CSET Merged Corpus of \\nScholarly Literature \\nSources \\nCSET’s merged corpus of scholarly literature \\ncombines distinct publications from Clarivate’s Web \\nof Science, OpenAlex, The Lens, Semantic Scholar, \\narXiv, and Papers With Code.\\nUpdates: The source list of scholarly literature for \\nCSET’s merged corpus has been changed from prior \\nyears, with the inclusion of OpenAlex, the Lens, \\nand Semantic Scholar, and the exclusion of Digital \\nScience’s Dimensions and the Chinese National \\nKnowledge Infrastructure (CNKI).\\nMethodology \\nTo create the merged corpus, CSET deduplicated \\nacross the listed sources using publication metadata, \\nand then combined the metadata for linked \\npublications. For analysis of AI publications, CSET \\nused an English-language subset of this corpus \\npublished since 2010. CSET researchers developed \\na classifier for identifying AI-related publications by \\nleveraging the arXiv repository, where authors and \\neditors tag papers by subject.3\\nUpdates: The AI classifier was updated from the \\nversion used in prior years; Dunham, Melot, and \\nMurdick4 describe the previously implemented \\n1 https:/ /eto.tech/tool-docs/cat/\\n2 https:/ /cat.eto.tech/\\n3 Christian Schoeberl, Autumn Toney, and James Dunham, “Identifying AI Research” (Center for Security and Emerging Technology, July 2023), https:/ /doi.org/10.51593/20220030.\\n4 James Dunham, Jennifer Melot, and Dewey Murdick, “Identifying the Development and Application of Artificial Intelligence in Scientific Text,” arXiv preprint, arXiv:2002.07143 (2020).'),\n",

Toney and Dunham describe the field of study \\nassignment pipeline used in this analysis; prior years \\nused the original MAG implementation.\\nCSET also provided publication counts and year-by-\\nyear citations for AI-relevant work associated with each \\ncountry. A publication is associated with a country \\nif it has at least one author whose organizational \\naffiliation(s) is located in that country. If there is \\nno observed country, the publication receives an \\n“Unknown/Missing” country label. Citation counts \\naren’t available for all publications; those without \\ncounts weren’t included in the citation analysis. Over \\n70% of English-language AI papers published between \\n2010 and 2022 have citation data available.\\nAdditionally, publication counts by year and by \\npublication type (e.g., academic journal articles, \\nconference papers) were provided where available.\\nThese publication types were disaggregated by \\naffiliation country as described above.\\nCSET also provided publication affiliation sector(s) \\nwhere, as in the country attribution analysis, sectors \\nwere associated with publications through authors’ \\naffiliations. Not all affiliations were characterized in \\nterms of sectors; CSET researchers relied primarily \\non ROR for this purpose, and not all organizations can \\nbe found in or linked to ROR.6 Where the affiliation \\nsector is available, papers were counted toward these \\nsectors, by year.\\nCSET counted cross-sector collaborations as distinct \\npairs of sectors across authors for each publication. \\nCollaborations are only counted once: For example, \\nif a publication has two authors with an academic \\naffiliation and two with an industry affiliation, it is \\ncounted as a single academic-industry collaboration.\\nPatents From CSET’s AI and Robotics Patents \\nDataset\\nSource \\nCSET’s AI patents dataset was developed by CSET \\nand 1790 Analytics and includes data from The Lens, \\n1790 Analytics, and EPO’s PATSTAT. Patents relevant \\nto the development and application of AI and robotics \\nwere identified by their CPC/IPC codes and keywords.\\nMethodology \\nIn this analysis, patents were grouped by year and \\ncountry, and then counted at the “patent family” \\n5 These scores are based on cosine similarities between field-of-study and paper embeddings. See Autumn Toney and James Dunham, “Multi-Label Classification of Scientific Research \\nDocuments Across Domains and Languages, ” Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing (Association for Computational Linguistics, 2022): 105–14, https:/ /\\naclanthology.org/2022.sdp-1.12/.\\n6 See https:/ /ror.org/ for more information about the ROR dataset.\\n7 Patents are analyzed at the “patent family” level rather than “patent document” level because patent families are a collective of patent documents all associated with a single invention and/\\nor innovation by the same inventors/assignees. Thus, counting at the “patent family” level mitigates artificial number inflation when there are multiple patent documents in a patent family or if \\na patent is filed in multiple jurisdictions.'),\n",

A snapshot of the Ecosystems Graph was taken in \\nearly January 2024. \\n 2.  Authors of foundation models are attributed to \\ncountries based on their affiliation credited on \\nthe paper/technical documentation associated \\nwith the model.

This method has the advantage of capturing updates within a patent \\nfamily (such as amendments). However, to remain consistent with CSET’s other data products, including the Country Activity Tracker (available at https:/ /cat.eto.tech/), we opted to \\nuse the first filing year instead in this data analysis.'),\n",

Each project \\nowner is assigned a location based on their IP address \\nwhen interacting with GitHub. If a project owner \\nchanges locations within a year, the location for the \\nproject would be determined by the mode location \\nof its owners sampled daily in the year. Additionally, \\nthe last known location of the project owner is \\ncarried forward on a daily basis even if no activities \\nwere performed by the project owner that day. For \\nexample, if a project owner performed activities \\nwithin the United States and then became inactive for \\nsix days, that project owner would be considered to \\nbe in the United States for that seven-day span.\\nTraining Cost Analysis\\nTo create the dataset of cost estimates, the Epoch \\ndatabase was filtered for models released during the \\nlarge-scale ML era9 that were above the median of \\ntraining compute in a two-year window centered on \\ntheir release date. This filtered for the largest-scale \\nML models. There were 138 qualifying systems based \\non these criteria. Of these systems, 48 had sufficient \\ninformation to estimate the training cost.\\nFor the selected ML models, the training time and \\nthe type, quantity, and utilization rate of the training \\nhardware were determined from the publication, \\npress release, or technical reports, as applicable. \\nCloud rental prices for the computing hardware used \\nby these models were collected from online historical \\narchives of cloud vendors’ websites.10\\n9 The selected cutoff date was September 1, 2015, in accordance with Compute Trends Across Three Eras of Machine Learning (Epoch, 2022).\\n10 Historic prices were collected from archived snapshots of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform price catalogs viewed through the Internet Archive \\nWayback Machine.'),\n",

This yielded the cost to train each \\nmodel using the same hardware used by the authors \\nto train the same model at the time. However, some \\ndevelopers purchased hardware rather than renting \\ncloud computers, so the true costs incurred by the \\ndevelopers may vary.\\nVarious challenges were encountered while estimating \\nthe training cost of these models. Often, the developers \\ndid not disclose the duration of training or the hardware \\nthat was used. In other cases, cloud compute pricing \\nwas not available for the hardware. The investigation \\nof training cost trends is continued in a forthcoming \\nEpoch report, including an expanded dataset with more \\nmodels and hardware prices.\\n11 The chosen rental cost rate was the most recent published price for the hardware and cloud vendor used by the developer of the model, at a three-year commitment rental rate, after \\nsubtracting the training duration and two months from the publication date. If this price was not available, the most analogous price was used: the same hardware and vendor at a different \\ndate, otherwise the same hardware from a different cloud vendor. If a three-year commitment rental rate was unavailable, this was imputed from other rental rates based on the empirical \\naverage discount for the given cloud vendor. If the exact hardware type was not available, e.g., “NVIDIA A100 SXM4 40GB,” then a generalization was used, e.g., “NVIDIA A100.”'),\n",

Specifically, the team scraped the \\nconference websites or repositories of conference \\nsubmissions for papers containing relevant keywords \\nindicating they could fall into a particular responsible \\nAI category. The papers were then manually verified \\nby a human team to confirm their categorization. It is \\npossible that a single paper could belong to multiple \\nresponsible AI categories.\\nChapter 3: Responsible AI\\nThe keywords searched include:\\nFairness and bias: algorithmic fairness, bias detection, \\nbias mitigation, discrimination, equity in AI, ethical \\nalgorithm design, fair data practices, fair ML, fairness \\nand bias, group fairness, individual fairness, justice, \\nnon-discrimination, representational fairness, unfair, \\nunfairness.\\nPrivacy and data governance: anonymity, \\nconfidentiality, data breach, data ethics, data \\ngovernance, data integrity, data privacy, data \\nprotection, data transparency, differential privacy, \\ninference privacy, machine unlearning, privacy by \\ndesign, privacy-preserving, secure data storage, \\ntrustworthy data curation.\\nSecurity: adversarial attack, adversarial learning, AI \\nincident, attacks, audits, cybersecurity, ethical hacking, \\nforensic analysis, fraud detection, red teaming, safety, \\nsecurity, security ethics, threat detection, vulnerability \\nassessment.\\nTransparency and explainability: algorithmic \\ntransparency, audit, auditing, causal reasoning, \\ncausality, explainability, explainable AI, explainable \\nmodels, human-understandable decisions, \\ninterpretability, interpretable models, model \\nexplainability, outcome explanation, transparency, xAI.\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2024 Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\nAppendix'),\n",

The AI Index did not consider subsequent \\nbenchmark reports by the model developers or external \\nparties. The AI Index also did not include benchmarks \\non academic or professional exams (e.g., the GRE), \\nbenchmarks for modalities other than text, or internal \\nevaluation metrics.\\nGlobal Responsible State of  \\nAI Survey\\nResearchers from Stanford conducted a global \\nresponsible AI (RAI) survey in collaboration with \\nAccenture. The objective of the questionnaire was \\nto gain an understanding of the current level of RAI \\nadoption globally and allow for a comparison of RAI \\nactivities across 19 industries and 22 countries. The \\nsurvey is further used to develop an early snapshot \\nof current perceptions around the responsible \\ndevelopment, deployment, and use of generative AI \\nand how this might affect RAI adoption and mitigation \\ntechniques. The survey covers a total of 10 RAI \\ndimensions: Reliability; Privacy and Data Governance; \\nFairness and Nondiscrimination; Transparency and \\nExplainability; Human Interaction; Societal and \\nEnvironmental Well-Being; Accountability; Leadership/\\nPrinciples/Culture; Lawfulness and Compliance; and \\nOrganizational Governance. Only some of the survey \\nfindings are presented in the AI Index, with a more \\ndetailed report, the Global State of Responsible AI \\nReport, coming out in May/June 2024.\\nGiven the limited scalability of user interviews, the \\nresearchers opted for a questionnaire-based approach \\nto ensure broad coverage of organizations in different \\ncountries and industries. They contracted McGuire \\nResearch to run the recruitment and data collection. \\nThe team received more than 15,897 responses from \\n22 countries and 19 industries. The respondents were \\nasked 10 qualifier questions in the survey. Companies \\nwere excluded if their global annual revenue was less \\nthan 500 million USD and/or the respondent had no \\nvisibility into the RAI decision-making process of the \\ncompany. Included in the final sample were more \\nthan 1,000 organizations. The survey had a total of 38 \\nquestions, including the 10 qualifier questions.\\nBelow is the full list of measures respondents were \\nasked about in the survey and which were referenced \\nin the AI Index subchapters.

To assess \\nthe representativeness of job postings data, Lightcast \\nconducts a number of analyses to compare the \\ndistribution of job postings to the distribution of \\nofficial government and other third-party sources in \\nthe United States. The primary source of government \\ndata on U.S. job postings is the Job Openings \\nand Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) program, \\nconducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Currently, more than 41,000 \\ndistinct, standardized skills are identified by LinkedIn. \\nThese have been coded and classified by taxonomists \\nat LinkedIn into 249 skill groupings, which are the skill \\ngroups represented in the dataset.\\nSkill groupings are derived by expert taxonomists \\nthrough a similarity-index methodology that \\nmeasures skill composition at the industry level. \\nLinkedIn’s industry taxonomy and their corresponding \\nNAICS codes can be found here.\\nThis year LinkedIn made updates to the AI skills list \\nand categorized them into “AI Engineering” and “AI \\nLiteracy” skills.

This is done by multiplying two metrics:\\n1.  The term frequency of a skill in an entity (“TF”).\\n2.  The logarithmic inverse entity frequency of the \\nskill across a set of entities (“IDF”). This indicates \\nhow common or rare a word is in the entire entity \\nset. The closer IDF is to 0, the more common a \\nword is.\\nSo, if the skill is very common across LinkedIn entities, \\nand appears in many job or member descriptions, the \\nIDF will approach 0. If, on the other hand, the skill is \\nunique to specific entities, the IDF will approach 1. \\nDetails are available at LinkedIn’s Skills Genome and \\nLinkedIn–World Bank Methodology note.\\nAI Skills Penetration \\nThe aim of this indicator is to measure the intensity of \\nAI skills in an entity (in a particular country, industry, \\ngender, etc.) through the following methodology:\\n•   Compute frequencies for all self-added skills by \\nLinkedIn members in a given entity (occupation, \\nindustry, etc.) in 2015–2023.\\n•   Re-weight skill frequencies using a TF-IDF model \\nto get the top 50 most representative skills in \\nthat entity. These 50 skills compose the “skill \\ngenome” of that entity.\\n•   Compute the share of skills that belong to  \\nthe AI skill group out of the top skills in the \\nselected entity.\\nInterpretation: The AI skill penetration rate signals \\nthe prevalence of AI skills across occupations, or the \\nintensity with which LinkedIn members utilize AI skills \\nin their jobs. For example, the top 50 skills for the \\noccupation of engineer are calculated based on the \\nweighted frequency with which they appear in LinkedIn \\nmembers’ profiles. If four of the skills that engineers \\npossess belong to the AI skill group, this measure \\nindicates that the penetration of AI skills is estimated \\nto be 8% among engineers (e.g., 4/50).\\nJobs or Occupations\\nLinkedIn member titles are standardized and grouped \\ninto approximately 15,000 occupations. These are \\nnot sector- or country-specific. These occupations \\nare further standardized into approximately \\n3,600 occupation representatives. Occupation \\nrepresentatives group occupations with a common \\nrole and specialty, regardless of seniority.\\nAI Jobs or Occupations\\nAn “AI” job is an occupation representative \\nthat requires AI skills to perform the job. Skills \\npenetrations are used as a signal for whether AI skills \\nare prevalent in an occupation representative, in any \\nsector where the occupation representative may \\nexist. Examples of such occupations include (but are \\nnot limited to): Machine Learning Engineer, Artificial \\nIntelligence Specialist, Data Scientist, and Computer \\nVision Engineer.\\nAI Talent\\nA LinkedIn member is considered AI talent if they \\nhave explicitly added AI skills to their profile \\nand/ or they are occupied in an AI occupation \\nrepresentative. The counts of AI talent are used to \\ncalculate talent concentration metrics. For example, \\nto calculate the country-level AI talent concentration, \\nwe use the counts of AI talent at the country level \\nvis-a-vis the counts of LinkedIn members in the \\nrespective countries. Note that concentration metrics \\nmay be influenced by LinkedIn coverage in these \\ncountries and should be utilized with caution.'),\n",

Since the global \\naverages are distinct for each gender, this metric \\nshould only be used to compare country rankings \\nwithin each gender, and not for cross-gender \\ncomparisons within countries.\\nInterpretation: A country’s AI skills penetration for \\nwomen of 1.5 means that female members in that \\ncountry are 1.5 times more likely to list AI skills than \\nthe average female member in all countries pooled \\ntogether across the same set of occupations that \\nexist in the country/gender combination.\\nGlobal Comparison: Across Genders\\nThe “Relative AI Skills Penetration Across Genders” \\nmetric allows for cross-gender comparisons within \\nand across countries globally, since we compare the \\ncountries’ male/female AI skill penetrations to the \\nsame global average regardless of gender.\\nRelative AI Talent Hiring Rate YoY Ratio\\n•   LinkedIn Hiring Rate or Overall Hiring \\nRate is a measure of hires normalized by \\nLinkedIn membership. It is computed as the \\npercentage of LinkedIn members who added \\na new employer in the same period the job \\nbegan, divided by the total number of LinkedIn \\nmembers in the corresponding location.\\n•   AI Hiring Rate is computed following the \\noverall hiring rate methodology, but only \\nconsidering members classified as AI talent.\\n•   Relative AI Talent Hiring Rate YoY Ratio is \\nthe year-over-year change in AI Hiring Rate \\nrelative to Overall Hiring Rate in the same \\ncountry. For each month, we first calculate AI \\nHiring rate in the country, then divide AI Hiring \\nRate by Overall Hiring Rate in that country, '),\n",

[2018]).\\nLinkedIn migration rates are derived from the self-\\nidentified locations of LinkedIn member profiles. For \\nexample, when a LinkedIn member updates his or \\nher location from Paris to London, this is counted as \\na migration. Migration data is available from 2019 \\nonward. LinkedIn data provides insights into countries \\non the AI Talent gained or lost due to migration trends. \\nAI Talent migration is considered for all members \\nwith AI Skills/holding AI jobs at time t for country A \\nas the country of interest and country B as the source \\nof inflows and destination for outflows. Thus, net AI \\nTalent migration between country A and country B—for \\ncountry A—is calculated as follows:\\nNet flows are defined as total arrivals minus departures \\nwithin the given time period. LinkedIn membership \\nvaries considerably between countries, which makes \\ninterpreting absolute movements of members from \\none country to another difficult. To compare migration \\nflows between countries fairly, migration flows are \\nnormalized for the country of interest. For example, \\nif country A is the country of interest, all absolute net \\nflows into and out of country A, regardless of origin \\nand destination countries, are normalized based on \\nLinkedIn membership in country A at the end of each \\nyear and multiplied by 10,000. Hence, this metric \\nindicates relative talent migration from all countries to \\nand from country A.\\nAI Skills List Update Compared to Last Year\\n1.

A full list \\nof definitions and concepts used can be found in the \\nfootnotes shown at the bottom of the Statistics section.\\nSince each national data repository has its own \\nstructure and quite often provides all supporting \\ninformation in the national language, Informatics \\nEurope consults with its members—academics, \\nactive and knowledgeable in the informatics field \\nfrom respective countries—who help to interpret the \\nstatistics available and who understand the specificities \\nof these countries’ higher education systems. One \\nof the main challenges in integrating the statistical \\ndata is the identification of terms used to define the \\ninformatics discipline in different countries. Informatics \\nis known under different names in different European \\nlanguages and countries, and in English as well. A good \\ndozen terms (presented in the Data Portal section \\n“Subjects”) are used to denote what is fundamentally \\nthe same discipline, and the role of national experts \\nhere is to help with screening the terms and programs \\nand identifying which part of them is pertinent to the \\ninformatics field.\\nThe data covers the degrees delivered by both \\ntraditional Research Universities (RU) and University of \\nApplied Science (UAS) for the countries where these \\ninstitutions also offer bachelor’s and master’s studies \\nin informatics.
