# PDF Question Answering (RAG) App ðŸš€

This web application allows you to upload a PDF document, perform text extraction, and interact with a powerful Question Answering model based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system utilizes the LangChain framework, Google Generative AI, and FAISS to process the PDF and generate intelligent responses to user queries.

---

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Upload any PDF document and the system processes it for querying.
- **Question Answering**: Ask questions based on the uploaded document, and get answers derived from the documentâ€™s content.
- **FAISS Integration**: Efficient document retrieval using FAISS for similarity-based search.
- **Generative AI**: Leverages Googleâ€™s Generative AI to generate contextual responses to your queries.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A simple and interactive web interface for easy usage.

---

## Requirements

This project is built using **Python 3.10** and requires the following libraries:

- **langchain**
- **langchain_community**
- **langchain-google-genai**
- **python-dotenv**
- **streamlit**
- **langchain_experimental**
- **sentence-transformers**
- **langchain_faiss**
- **langchainhub**
- **pypdf**
- **rapidocr-onnxruntime**

You can install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-question-answering.git]
   cd Folder_name
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (if not already done):
   
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv web1
   source web1/bin/activate   # On Windows: web1\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required libraries**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your **Google API Key**:
   
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Run the application**:
   
   Start the Streamlit app using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will open the app in your default web browser, where you can upload PDFs and ask questions.

## How to Use the App

1. **Upload a PDF File**: 
   - Click on the **Upload** button to select a PDF document from your local system.
   
2. **Ask Questions**:
   - Once the PDF is processed, type your question in the text input box and click **Submit Question**.
   - The system will retrieve relevant information from the document and provide an answer.

3. **Adjust Temperature**:
   - You can adjust the **temperature** slider to control the randomness of the generative AI responses.

## Example Workflow

1. Upload a PDF document.
2. Wait for the document to be processed and indexed.
3. Enter a question related to the PDF content.
4. Get an accurate and concise answer based on the document's context.
